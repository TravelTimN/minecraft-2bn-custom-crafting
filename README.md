## ♻️ [Back-to-Blocks](back-to-blocks/)

A Minecraft datapack that adds hundreds of crafting recipes to reverse decorative/utility blocks back into a *lossy*<sup>*</sup> base form. Go beyond slabs and stairs; reclaim any of the supported block types below.

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boats | chest boats | rafts | chest rafts |
| buttons | pressure plates | doors | trapdoors |
| signs | hanging signs | slabs | stairs |
| fences | fence gates | walls | |
| quartz | redstone components | workstations | utility blocks |
| bulbs | grates | resin | |

<sup>*</sup> Lossy base form means the original materials aren't fully recoverable; reverse-crafting comes with a deliberate loss, and is not intended to be 1:1.

## 🔨📦 [Craftables](craftables/)

A modular collection of Minecraft datapacks that unlock crafting recipes for **rare**, **unobtainable**, or just annoyingly grindy items. These recipes are balanced, lore-friendly (where possible), and designed with younger or less hardcore players in mind.

Each craftable tweak is its own standalone pack. Pick and choose the ones you want.

### 🎨 [Dyes](craftables/dyes/)

This datapack expands your dye-making repertoire with **alternative, lore-friendly recipes** for a handful of hard-to-find or biome-dependent colors. Whether you're stuck in a snowy wasteland or just tired of chasing squids, you’ll appreciate the pigmental perks below:

| Dye | Craft Options | Supports |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🧡 Orange | Resin Clump | 1.21.4+ |
| 💚 Green | Kelp | 1.20.0+ |
| 💜 Purple | Chorus Fruit, Amethyst Shard | 1.20.0+ |
| 🖤 Black | Coal, Charcoal | 1.20.0+ |

All recipes aim to be balanced, thematic, and helpful for younger players, or just anyone who’s dyeing for a better solution.

### 🪞 [Echo Shard](craftables/echo-shard/)

Craftable echo shards, so you can avoid looting multiple Ancient Cities *and* avoid making eye contact with the Warden. Echoes of wisdom, not screams.

Great for recovery compasses, lore builds, or just skipping the part where you get yeeted into the void by a blind shrieking deathbeast.

### 💿 [Music Discs](craftables/music-discs/)

This datapack adds shaped crafting recipes for every **music disc** and **disc fragment** - because sometimes you just want the tunes without the *kaboom*.

No more luring charged creepers toward scary mobs, or your sanity. Just craft your vibe, and drop the beat!

Perfect for jukebox collectors, mapmakers, or anyone who thinks *Pigstep* should be more accessible than a Bastion's basement.

### 🏺 [Pottery Sherds](craftables/pottery-sherds/)

Triplicate those precious archaeological finds! This datapack lets you **clone pottery sherds** using bricks and terracotta. Simply combine any pottery sherd with supporting materials to get three more, so you end up with **4 total**.

Perfect for decorative builders or lore nerds who want matching sets without raiding every suspicious sand pile in a 1,000-block radius.

### 💀 [Skulls](craftables/skulls/)

This datapack adds **shaped crafting recipes** to create some iconic mob heads using dye, mob-related items, and a sacrificial *wither skeleton skull*. Great for builders, mapmakers, trophy hunters... or anyone with a flair for the dramatic.

**Note:** Recipes are intentionally expensive and lore-balanced. You're literally *reanimating skulls* here. Not exactly light work, but perhaps easier than using charged creepers, eh?

## 🪽 [Craftable Elytra](craftable-elytra/)

Some players are terrified of visiting the End dimension, and therefore have to pay other players to obtain [Elytra](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Elytra) or Shulker Boxes for them. It might take a bit longer and be rather expensive, but some may consider it far better than going to the End. Plus, for hardcore players, this means potentially having wings before defeating the dragon, Jane!

## ♻️🎨 [Universal Dyeing](universal-dyeing/)

A Minecraft datapack that breaks the vanilla dye barrier. **Re-dye** or **un-dye** several types of blocks. Whether you're fixing a color mistake, or just feeling fickle, this pack lets you flex your palette.

Use **any dye** to recolor these blocks, or use **ice** to scrub them back to their non-dyed form<sup>*</sup>.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| candles<sup>*</sup> | | |
| carpets | wool | |
| concrete | concrete powder | |
| terracotta* | glazed terracotta | |
| stained glass<sup>*</sup> | stained glass panes<sup>*</sup> | |
| sand | sandstone | smooth sandstone |
| red sand<sup>*</sup> | red sandstone<sup>*</sup> | smooth red sandstone<sup>*</sup> |

<sup>*</sup> These blocks can be **un-dyed** using ice to revert them to their natural, uncolored state.
