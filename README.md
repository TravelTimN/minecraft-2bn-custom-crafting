## ♻️ [Back-to-Blocks](back-to-blocks/)

A Minecraft datapack that adds hundreds of crafting recipes to reverse decorative/utility blocks back into a *lossy*<sup>*</sup> base form. Go beyond slabs and stairs; reclaim any of the supported block types below.

| | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| boats | chest boats | rafts | chest rafts |
| buttons | pressure plates | doors | trapdoors |
| signs | hanging signs | slabs | stairs |
| fences | fence gates | walls | |
| quartz | redstone components | workstations | utility blocks |
| bulbs | grates | resin | |

<sup>*</sup> Lossy base form means the original materials aren't fully recoverable; reverse-crafting comes with a deliberate loss, and is not intended to be 1:1.

## 🔨📦 [Craftables](craftables/)

A modular collection of Minecraft datapacks that unlock crafting recipes for **rare**, **unobtainable**, or just annoyingly grindy items. These recipes are balanced, lore-friendly (where possible), and designed with younger or less hardcore players in mind.

Each craftable tweak is its own standalone pack. Pick and choose the ones you want.

### 🏺 [Pottery Sherds](craftables/pottery-sherds/)

Triplicate those precious archaeological finds! This datapack lets you **clone pottery sherds** using bricks and terracotta. Simply combine any pottery sherd with supporting materials to get three more, so you end up with **4 total**.

Perfect for decorative builders or lore nerds who want matching sets without raiding every suspicious sand pile in a 1,000-block radius.

## 🎨 [Craftable Dyes](craftable-dyes/)

Sometimes [dyes](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Dye) can be tough to obtain, or take forever to smelt. We've added a solution to allow easier access to the following dyes:

| Dye | Recipe | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| black | coal / charcoal | crafting table |
| green | kelp | crafting table |

## 🪽 [Craftable Elytra](craftable-elytra/)

Some players are terrified of visiting the End dimension, and therefore have to pay other players to obtain [Elytra](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Elytra) or Shulker Boxes for them. It might take a bit longer and be rather expensive, but some may consider it far better than going to the End. Plus, for hardcore players, this means potentially having wings before defeating the dragon, Jane!

## ✨ [Craftable Rarities](craftable-rarities/)

Sometimes items are quite difficult to collect, or perhaps you're trying to obtain a stack of everything as part of the [BlazeandCaves](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1zlRBAkHZhoMlGBbLIvKGxY4wufVVpAhYko48QH6LDNs/edit?gid=0#gid=0) "super challenges". We've made it possible to craft a few of the more *difficult-to-obtain* items:

- [Disc Fragment 5](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Disc_Fragment)
- [Echo Shard](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Echo_Shard)
- [Heart of the Sea](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Heart_of_the_Sea)

## ♻️🎨 [Universal Dyeing](universal-dyeing/)

A Minecraft datapack that breaks the vanilla dye barrier. **Re-dye** or **un-dye** several types of blocks. Whether you're fixing a color mistake, or just feeling fickle, this pack lets you flex your palette.

Use **any dye** to recolor these blocks, or use **ice** to scrub them back to their non-dyed form<sup>*</sup>.

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| candles<sup>*</sup> | | |
| carpets | wool | |
| concrete | concrete powder | |
| terracotta* | glazed terracotta | |
| stained glass<sup>*</sup> | stained glass panes<sup>*</sup> | |
| sand | sandstone | smooth sandstone |
| red sand<sup>*</sup> | red sandstone<sup>*</sup> | smooth red sandstone<sup>*</sup> |

<sup>*</sup> These blocks can be **un-dyed** using ice to revert them to their natural, uncolored state.
